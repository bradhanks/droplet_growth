## Immediate Impact: Mobile UX Audit and Analytics "Quick Wins"

Before embarking on the larger build, several high-impact, low-effort improvements can be made.

### Mobile UX Audit

-   **Navigation:** Simplify the main navigation menu for mobile screens.
-   **Readability:** Ensure a minimum font size of 16px for body text.
-   **Forms:** Keep lead capture forms simple and ask only for essential information.

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup and Pilot Program (First 30 Days)

The first month is dedicated to building and validating the complete technical infrastructure on a small, manageable scale.

## Phase 2: Scaling the Content Engine (Days 31-90)

With the foundation validated, the focus shifts to scaling content production and launching a significant volume of pages.

## Phase 3: Continuous Optimization and Expansion (Beyond 90 Days)

The final phase transitions the project to a continuous cycle of data-driven optimization and strategic expansion.
