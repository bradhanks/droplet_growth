# SSR Analytics Upgrade

To combat data loss from ad-blockers and improve accuracy, we will implement a server-to-server analytics tracking system.

## Benefits

* **Increased Accuracy:** Capture user interactions that client-side tracking misses.
* **Improved Page Performance:** Shifting tracking logic from the client's browser to the server reduces page load.
* **Enhanced Security & Control:** Greater control over what data is sent to third-party analytics platforms.
