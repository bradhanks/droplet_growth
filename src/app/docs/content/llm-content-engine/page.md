## Architecting the Content Pipeline

The creation of hundreds of landing pages will follow a standardized, multi-phase pipeline that ensures quality control at each stage.

### Phase 1: Keyword Cluster & Topic Identification
The process begins with the strategic selection of a keyword cluster to target.

### Phase 2: Outline Generation (LLM-Assisted)
An LLM is used to accelerate the creation of a comprehensive "hub-and-spoke" content plan.

### Phase 3: Prompt Engineering & AI-Drafting
For each topic, a pre-defined, role-based prompt is used to generate the initial draft of the landing page content.

### Phase 4: Human Review & Enhancement (The E-E-A-T Layer)
This is the most critical step. The AI-generated draft is passed to a human subject matter expert for verification and enhancement.

### Phase 5: Data Formatting & Staging
The finalized content is structured into a standardized format (e.g., a CSV file).

### Phase 6: Programmatic Publishing
The structured data file is uploaded to HubDB in HubSpot, triggering the automatic creation of the new landing pages.
