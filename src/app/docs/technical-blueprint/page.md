## HubDB vs. CRM Objects

HubSpot offers two primary mechanisms for creating data-driven dynamic pages: HubDB and CRM Objects. A hybrid approach is required to overcome platform limitations.

### Proposed Architecture: The Hybrid Model

-   **HubDB for Content Storage:** A master HubDB table will serve as the "single source of truth" for all programmatic landing page content.
-   **HubDB Multi-Level Structure for Scalability:** To circumvent the 10-page-listing limit, we will employ HubSpot's multi-level dynamic page functionality.
-   **CRM Custom Objects for Advanced Linking & Automation:** A CRM Custom Object named "Programmatic Page" will be created for sophisticated internal linking and integration with HubSpot's automation tools.

## Engineering a Scalable Internal Linking Architecture

A robust internal linking structure is critical for signaling topical authority to search engines.

### Technique 1: Basic Dynamic Linking (HubL)
The foundation of the linking structure will be built directly into the dynamic page template using HubL.

### Technique 2: Multi-Level Linking (Child Tables)
The multi-level architecture using parent and child tables naturally creates a hierarchical linking structure.

### Technique 3: Advanced Related-Content Linking (Foreign ID / CRM Object)
The most powerful and flexible method utilizes the "Programmatic Page" custom object.
