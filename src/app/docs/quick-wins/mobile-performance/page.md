# Fix Mobile Performance

Mobile experience is critical for user engagement and SEO. Our focus will be on:

1.  **Optimizing Core Web Vitals (CWV):** Reducing LCP, FID, and CLS.
2.  **Image Optimization:** Implementing next-gen formats (WebP), lazy loading, and proper sizing.
3.  **Reducing JavaScript Execution Time:** Auditing and deferring non-critical scripts.
4.  **Leveraging Browser Caching:** Ensuring assets are cached effectively to speed up repeat visits.
