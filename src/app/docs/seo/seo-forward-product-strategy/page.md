# SEO-Forward Product Strategy

We will use SEO data not just for marketing, but to inform the product roadmap itself.

## Process

1.  **Keyword Research as Market Research:** Analyze search queries to identify user pain points, desired features, and product gaps.
2.  **Competitor Analysis:** Use SEO tools to see what features competitors are building and how users are responding.
3.  **Build SEO-Friendly Features:** Create product features that naturally generate user-generated content or have high search demand.
