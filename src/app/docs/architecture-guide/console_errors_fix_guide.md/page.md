    title: Console Errors Fix Guide - Day 1 Priority Tasks
    description: Comprehensive guide to resolve critical console errors including CORS issues, performance violations, and blocked resources affecting site functionality.
---

Critical console errors are impacting your site's performance, security, and user experience. These issues range from CORS policy violations to performance bottlenecks and blocked advertising resources that directly affect revenue.

---

## Critical Priority Fixes (Day 1)

These errors are actively breaking functionality and should be addressed immediately to restore proper site operation.

### CORS and Resource Loading Errors

Your site is experiencing multiple CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy violations and blocked resources that are preventing essential functionality from working properly.

```js
// Example of proper CORS header configuration
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'https://yourdomain.com');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type, Authorization');
  next();
});
```

**LinkedIn Ads Tracking Issues**: The console shows multiple `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors for LinkedIn pixel tracking (`px.ads.linkedin.com`). This is likely caused by ad blockers or privacy extensions, but you should implement fallback tracking and ensure your LinkedIn Campaign Manager is properly configured.

**SVG Attribute Errors**: The `<svg>` elements have invalid width and height attributes expecting "length" but receiving "auto". Update your SVG markup to use proper dimensional values or remove the attributes to use default sizing.

### Performance Violations

Multiple `requestAnimationFrame` handler violations are occurring, indicating JavaScript execution is blocking the main thread for extended periods.

**Animation Performance Issues**: Handlers are taking 50-230ms to execute, which is far above the recommended 16ms for smooth 60fps animations. The violations are coming from `droplet-stage.schunk.d5559d2f0cd9f8.js` and `modules.3128f1e...js`.

Optimize your animation code by:
- Breaking long-running operations into smaller chunks
- Using `requestIdleCallback` for non-critical work
- Implementing proper throttling for scroll and resize events
- Moving heavy computations to Web Workers where possible

## High Priority Security Fixes

These security-related issues should be resolved within 24-48 hours to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

### Content Security Policy Updates

Based on the earlier analysis, your CSP needs updating to allow legitimate inline scripts while maintaining security.

Add these SHA256 hashes to your `script-src` directive:
- `'sha256-xr9xlIo0Ge14fOEq0f6ZC0Zf97/9nwKygDiQ1oH0+Uw='`
- `'sha256-vugjdwQog2dGIN3x3hkNFuL5grgx1IGFkud/HBtwwxM='`

### Third-Party Script Audit

Your site loads numerous third-party scripts that may be contributing to the performance issues. Review each script for necessity and implement lazy loading where appropriate.

**Essential vs Non-Essential Scripts**: Categorize your third-party scripts by business importance. Chat widgets, analytics, and advertising pixels are typically essential, while social media widgets and some tracking scripts can be deferred.

## Medium Priority Optimizations

These improvements will enhance user experience and should be implemented within the next week.

### Resource Loading Optimization

The blocked LinkedIn ads resources indicate potential issues with your advertising setup that could be impacting revenue tracking.

**Advertising Pixel Fixes**:
- Verify LinkedIn Campaign Manager configuration
- Implement server-side tracking as a fallback
- Consider using a tag management system to better control script loading
- Test pixel firing in incognito mode to identify client-side blocking

### JavaScript Bundle Optimization

The large JavaScript chunks (`droplet-stage.schunk.d5559d2f0cd9f8.js`) suggest your bundle could benefit from code splitting and lazy loading.

**Bundle Splitting Strategy**:
- Split vendor libraries from application code
- Implement route-based code splitting
- Use dynamic imports for non-critical functionality
- Consider preloading critical chunks only

### Animation Performance Tuning

The repeated `requestAnimationFrame` violations suggest animations are not properly optimized.

**Animation Best Practices**:
- Use CSS transforms instead of JavaScript for simple animations
- Implement proper frame rate limiting
- Use `transform3d()` to enable hardware acceleration
- Profile animations to identify bottlenecks

## Long-term Monitoring and Prevention

Implement these measures to prevent similar issues from recurring and maintain optimal performance.

### Error Monitoring Setup

Establish proper error tracking to catch these issues before they impact users significantly.

**Monitoring Implementation**:
- Set up client-side error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- Monitor Core Web Vitals metrics
- Track advertising pixel success rates
- Alert on performance regression thresholds

### Performance Budget

Establish performance budgets to prevent future regressions in your JavaScript bundles and third-party script loading.

**Budget Guidelines**:
- Main thread blocking time under 50ms
- JavaScript bundle size limits by route
- Third-party script loading time limits
- Animation frame rate consistency targets

Regular performance audits and console error monitoring will help maintain optimal user experience while ensuring all tracking and advertising functionality operates correctly.
